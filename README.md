Code to reproduce the figures and analyses of the manuscript "A Comprehensive Assessment of the Digital Therapeutics Trials in China: Prioritirs, Quality and Inclusivity of Design".
Digital therapeutics (DTx) are software-based health interventions designed to treat or manage diseases, disorders, conditions, or injuries by generating and delivering medical interventions that have proven therapeutic benefits for patient health. Here, we identified and analyzed Chinese DTx trials registered on ChiCTR or ClinicalTrials.gov and conducted a comprehensive overview of DTx trial landscape in China.

## Accessing the research data
To recreate the full dataset from the original website (for example, if the researcher wants to update the dataset by changing time points), the researcher needs to download ClinicalTrial_info.ipynb and query the registry according to the paper's methods.

## Analyzing
The analysis and graphs can be found in the executable Analyze_DTx_jupy.ipynb. The code runs on Python 3.8 and requires standard OpenSource packages such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn.
